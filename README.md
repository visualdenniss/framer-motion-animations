Let's collect some good and reusable animation settings for framer-motion.

This is an open-source project that contains some collections of animation settings, transition easing values etc. including the examples from the official Framer-Motion Docs.

For simple props that can be passed to motion components, the animation settings are stored in animation.js and passed as props using destructing after being imported.

More complex animations have their own dedicated components (like SliderDemo)

To contribute, simply fork the project and then pull it to your local, after making changes and new commits, push it to your remote repo and then send a pull request to this repo.
